# Apple GPU Info

This is a mini-framework for querying parameters of an Apple-designed GPU. It also contains a command-line tool, `gpuinfo`, which reports information similarly to [clinfo](https://github.com/Oblomov/clinfo). It was co-authored with an AI.

## Features

Listed parameters:
- Name ✅
- Vendor ✅
- Core count ✅
- Clock frequency ✅
- Bandwidth ✅
- FLOPS (FP32 operations per second) ✅
- IPS (shader instructions per second) ✅
- System-level cache ✅
- Memory ✅
- Family ✅

Interfaces:
- Swift module
- [C bindings](./Sources/AppleGPUInfo/include/AppleGPUInfo/AppleGPUInfo.h)
- Command-line tool

Recognized devices:
- A7 - A17 Pro
- M1 - M2 Ultra
- M3 - M3 Max
- Future devices treated like the closest existing analog (e.g. M4 like M3)

## Usage

One way to use this library is from the command-line:

```
git clone https://github.com/philipturner/applegpuinfo
cd applegpuinfo
swift run gpuinfo list

# Sample output
GPU name: Apple M1 Max
GPU vendor: Apple
GPU core count: 32
GPU clock frequency: 1.296 GHz
GPU bandwidth: 409.6 GB/s
GPU FLOPS: 10.617 TFLOPS
GPU IPS: 5.308 TIPS
GPU system level cache: 48 MB
GPU memory: 32 GB
GPU family: Apple 7
```

You can also use it directly from Swift:

```swift
// Inside package manifest
dependencies: [
  // Dependencies declare other packages that this package depends on.
  .package(url: "https://github.com/philipturner/applegpuinfo", branch: "main"),
],

// Inside source code
import AppleGPUInfo

let device = try GPUInfoDevice()
print(device.flops)
print(device.bandwidth)
```

## Methodology

Original Goal: In one hour, finish a mini-package and command-line tool for querying Apple GPU device parameters.

Results: I spent 57 minutes finishing the file that wraps the `AppleGPUDevice` structure. I asked GPT-4 to generate the tests and command-line tool. I renamed the command-line tool from `applegpuinfo` to `gpuinfo` according to the AI's suggestion. Finally, I congratulated it and asked for it to leave a comment to users on the README. That triggered a safeguard and it quit the conversation. The stop time was 1 hour, 25 minutes.

Documentation of AI contributions: [bing-conversation.md](./Documentation/bing-conversation.md)

After creating the first release of the library, I have continued experimenting with workflows accelerated by _free_ access to GPT-4. The above document details these subsequent modifications to the library.

## Testing

This framework is confirmed to work on the following devices. If anyone wishes to contribute to this list, please paste the output of `gpuinfo` into a new GitHub issue. Next, paste the last 15 lines generated by the following command. Different variations of the same chip (e.g. different cores or memory) are welcome.

```
sudo powermetrics --sample-rate 500 --samplers gpu_power
```

`gpuinfo` runs on macOS. On iOS, you need to create an Xcode project. 
- Go to <b>File > New > Project > iOS > App</b>. 
- Click <b>Next</b>, ensure the interface is <b>SwiftUI</b>, and give the project a name. Click <b>Next > Create</b>.
- Go to <b>File > Add Package Dependencies > Search or Enter Package URL</b>. Type https://github.com/philipturner/applegpuinfo and click <b>Add Package</b>.
- Select the <b>AppleGPUInfo</b> product of kind <b>Library</b>, then click <b>Add Package</b>.
- Replace the code in `ContentView.swift` with the demonstration below.
- Connect your iOS device to your Mac with a USB cable. Ensure it is targeted in the [build destination](./Documentation/build-destination-screenshot.png).
- Press `Cmd + R` and look for text in the Xcode console.
- Paste the console output into a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/philipturner/applegpuinfo/issues).

```swift
import AppleGPUInfo
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      Image(systemName: "globe")
        .imageScale(.large)
        .foregroundStyle(.tint)
      Text({ () -> String in
        logHardwareSpecifications()
        return "Hello, world!"
      }())
    }
    .padding()
  }
}

func logHardwareSpecifications() {
  do {
    // Create an instance of GPUInfoDevice using its initializer
    let error = setenv("GPUINFO_LOG_LEVEL", "1", 1)
    if error != 0 {
      print("'setenv' failed with error code '\(error)'.")
    }
    _ = try GPUInfoDevice()
  } catch {
    // Handle any errors that may occur
    print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
  }
}
```
